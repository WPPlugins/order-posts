=== wp-orderposts ===Contributors: ucantblamemDonate link:Tags: order, posts, ordering, postRequires at least: 2.2Tested up to: 2.2Stable tag: trunk== Description ==Allows you to freely order posts by context rather than date.Let’s take a simple example; Reasonable Faith is a website setup for author Wez Hitzke to publish his short essays on Christian Apologetics. Each article belongs to one or more categories and visitors to the site can comment on each of the articles.While Wez tends to release a new article every month or so, it is more important that each article is given correct context within a category. For this reason, articles on that site are ordered so that they follow a logical flow from one article to the next based on their content (and not their date).**See the Installation tab for more information about the usage.**== Installation === Installation =Installing this plugin, as with any wordpress plugin, is relatively easy:   1. Download the ZIP file and extract the wp-orderposts.php script.   2. Put the script in the plugins folder of your Wordpress installation. This is usually found in the wp-content folder.   3. Login to your Wordpress admin; click on plugins and activate the Order Posts plugin.   4. You need to add a line of code to the index.php and archive.php files of your template so that they display posts in your specified order:Open each of these files and find the line that reads:<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>Now, immediately before that line, paste the following code into archive.php:<?php $offset = ($paged) ? (int) (get_option('posts_per_page') * ($paged - 1)) : 0; ?><?php query_posts("cat=".$cat. "&orderby=menu_order&order=ASC&offset={$offset}"); ?>And the following code into index.php:<?php $offset = ($paged) ? (int) (get_option('posts_per_page') * ($paged - 1)) : 0; ?><?php query_posts("orderby=menu_order&order=ASC&offset={$offset}"); ?>= Usage =To start using the installed plugin, simply login to your Wordpress admin area, click on Manage and then Order Posts in the management sub-menu.You will see a list of categories on your site and all the articles for each.To start with, none of the posts within each category will be numbered correctly, but after the first time you move an article (either up or down) the plugin will give each article an order number (which displays on the very left of each article in the list.Ordering is easy; simply click the [+] button for any article to move it down the list and [-] to move up the list.
